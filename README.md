🚀 **About Me**  
I am a **Data Scientist at Katonic AI** with a passion for **MLOps, Generative AI, and NLP**. I specialize in building **AI-driven applications**, optimizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems**, and **fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  

🔬 **What I Do**  
- 📌 **RAG Optimization** – Reduced latency bottlenecks and improved chatbot performance by 30%.  
- 📌 **AI-Powered Document & Image Analysis** – Built systems for structured interpretation of unstructured data.  
- 📌 **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech** – Integrated OpenAI APIs for voice-based AI interactions.  
- 📌 **ETL Pipelines & Web Scraping** – Developed scalable pipelines using **Kubeflow**, **AWS S3**, and **MongoDB**.  
- 📌 **Automated Invoice Management** – Built an AI-driven invoice validation system for anomaly detection.  
- 📌 **NLP-Driven Resume Screening** – Automated candidate ranking based on AI-powered entity extraction.
